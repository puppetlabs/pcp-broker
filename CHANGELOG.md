This is a maintenance release

* Logs failure to deliver error messages and associate response to debug. These

## 1.0.0

This is a major breaking release with significant new features. It introduces
PCP v2 while maintaining limited compatibility with PCP v1. See
[pcp-specifications](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pcp-specifications)
for details of changes in PCP v2. Note that in this release, pcp-broker ignores
the `subscribe` property of inventory requests and does not send inventory
updates.

The major changes in behavior are

* Delayed message delivery is no longer supported; message expiration is ignored
  in v1 messages.
* Multicast messaging is no longer supported; only messages with a single target
  will be allowed.
* Session association is deprecated. Client types may be specified by appending
  them to the connection URI; when not supplied client type defaults to agent.
  The client type established on connection must be used in any
  session_association requests.
* Debug chunks are no longer created or retransmitted.

Specific changes included

* [PCP-645](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PCP-645) Implement PCP v2
* [PCP-637](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/PCP-637) Remove message
  persistence, multicast, and ActiveMQ

  context.
