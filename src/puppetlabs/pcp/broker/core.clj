;; verification to ensure the identity (authentication) of the outbound connection and
;; use a whitelist of message types instead of trapperkeeper-authorization to authorize
;; messages.

;; messages can be received from the connection (in particular, the initial
;; inventory request) before our internal record-keeping considers the
;; connection to be ready. In that case, we briefly wait for the connection to
;; "complete" before processing the message, so that we can properly send a
